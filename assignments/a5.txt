9, 10, 11 not already covered by someone else in the class (check
the email list)

Written report: 2017-12-15:
Chose 5 of: 10.2, 10.3, 10.5, 10.6, 10.8, 10.9, 10.11, 10.12, 11.5, 11.9, 11.11

Extra Credit: SVMlight, 10 points extra credit:
see: http://www.cs.cornell.edu/People/tj/svm_light/
* 1 point:
work through the "Inductive SVM" example, discuss in detail the steps and resulting output
* 9 points: 
- create your own example modeled after the "Inductive SVM" example
- pick a topic (e.g., "Australia") and provide 100 positive and 100 negative examples for training data:
  -- using the Reuters-21578 collection (linked from the SVMlight page)
  -- or, create your own collection with crawled web pages 
- pick 30 documents not in the training set for your test data
- stem the words in the collection, using TFIDF as the features (compute for the 230 documents)
- train, classify, and discuss the results

Extra Credit: Wiki Small collection, 8 points extra credit:
* download the wikipedia.org page URIs from the live web.  
* summarize the HTTP status codes returned -- all 200?  Redirections? 404s?  do we still have 6043 documents?  or have their been splits &  merges (see also: wikipedia disambiguation pages)?  (1 pt)
* compare and contrast the in- and out-links from this collection. the number, the domains linked to, the HTTP status of the non-wikipedia links in the article (i.e., are they 200, 404, or something else?). (1 pt)
* compare the least and most popular articles (in terms of in-links) in the 2008 snapshot vs. the least and most popular articles in your 2017 snapshot. (1 pt)
* compare and contrast the anchor text for the articles in the collection: are we gaining or losing terms? (1 pt)
* compare and contrast the sizes of the same pages (i.e., 2008 vs. 2017) in: (2 pts)
- bytes
- total terms
- total unique terms
* for all of the pages (i.e., treat each collection as a single unit), compare the 2008 vs. 2017 snapshots in: (2 pts)
- bytes
- total terms
- total unique terms
